Q&A

Q: does this support texture maps?

A: absoloutly yes, it supports diffuse textures.

Q: why does it look so colorless or dull?

A: most likely because your color management is set to filmic instead of standard, this shader is meant for standard to have most pure colors.

Q: does this work in cycles

A: i made this shader for eevee, and therefore it only works in eevee.

Q: does this have normal map support?

A: Yes it supports normal maps and will influence the holographic shading

Q: can this be used in ue4 or other third party software?

A: no, simply because this material setup has quite a few layers to it, and because of blenders unique material system, they cannot be exported to be used in other software.

Q: does this work for blender versions below 2.8?

A: no, because this shader is exclusive for eevee and older blender versions below 2.8 dont have eevee
